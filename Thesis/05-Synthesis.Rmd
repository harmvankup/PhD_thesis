# Synthesis
This thesis provides novel insights into the formation, composition, and stability of vivianite in intertidal
sediments. This chapter will begin with a summary of the key findings and their potential implications for the
role of vivianite in phosphorus (P) cycling in coastal sediments. The discussion will then extend to how the
presented findings may apply to various environmental systems and be relevant to other research fields. An
examination will follow, discussing how the developed methodology for in-situ studies in this thesis widens
our geochemical toolbox and opens various avenues to study in-situ Fe mineral transformation processes.
Additionally, this chapter suggests possible directions for future research.
