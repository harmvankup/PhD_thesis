Biological sulfate reduction offers the advantage of less sludge production, less operational cost and efficiency in comparison to the physicochemical processes. Depending upon the feeding and operating conditions as well as microbes used, a number of intermediates are formed that may greatly affect the overall performance of bioreactor. This article extensively explores the bacterial community, formation of intermediates and desirable end products, theoretical and practical aspects of various environmental and operating conditions, and performance of bioreactors used for treating sulfate rich wastewater along with process biokinetics involved in biological sulfate reduction.},

The conversion of nitrogen can be carried out through both biological and physical processes. Important processes in the nitrogen cycle include fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. The majority of Earth's atmosphere (78\%) is atmospheric nitrogen, making it the largest source of nitrogen. However, atmospheric nitrogen has limited availability for biological use, leading to a scarcity of usable nitrogen in many types of ecosystems. The nitrogen cycle is of particular interest to ecologists because nitrogen availability can affect the rate of key ecosystem processes, including primary production and decomposition. Human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, use of artificial nitrogen fertilizers, and release of nitrogen in wastewater have dramatically altered the global nitrogen cycle. Human modification of the global nitrogen cycle can negatively affect the natural environment system and also human health.},

Whilst these events led to profound advances in technology, public health and food production, they have fundamentally broken the global phosphorus cycle.

In addition, these relationships give some insight into the properties of flooded sediments. Unlike terrestrial soils, made of gas, liquid and solid phases, flooded sediments are made practically of only two phases, liquid and solid. Since all voids are filled with water, it is possible to evaluate soil porosity and bulk density, directly from the moisture content of the soil, a property easily determined. The correlation between bulk density and organic matter was tested in six different systems (n=868), including rivers and fish pond sediments in Israel, fish pond sediments in Alabama, USA, and Abbassa, Egypt, lake sediments in New Zealand, alpine lake sediments in Colorado, USA, and sea floor sediments from the Northwest African continental slope. Sediment bulk density was inversely related to the organic carbon concentration. The regression for all the data points was:Bulk density (g/cm3)=1.776-0.363Loge OC(R2=0.70)where OC is the organic carbon concentration (mg/g). The relationship between sediment moisture, bulk density and organic carbon described here can be used as a simple means to estimate the organic content and bulk density of flooded mineral soils by a simple determination of a sediment water content.},

  abstract = {End member mixing analysis (EMMA) is a commonly applied method to identify and quantify the dominant runoff producing sources of water. It employs tracers to determine the dimensionality of the hydrologic system. Many EMMA studies have been conducted using two to six tracers, with some of the main tracers being Ca, Na, Cl-, water isotopes, and alkalinity. Few studies use larger tracer sets including minor trace elements such as Li, Rb, Sr, and Ba. None of the studies has addressed the question of the tracer set size and composition, despite the fact that these determine which and how many end members (EM) will be identified. We examine how tracer set size and composition affects the conceptual model that results from an EMMA. We developed an automatic procedure that conducts EMMA while iteratively changing tracer set size and composition. We used a set of 14 tracers and 9 EMs. The validity of the resulting conceptual models was investigated under the aspects of dimensionality, EM combinations, and contributions to stream water. From the 16,369 possibilities, 23 delivered plausible results. The resulting conceptual models are highly sensitive to the tracer set size and composition. The moderate reproducibility of EM contributions indicates a still missing EM. It also emphasizes that the major elements are not always the most useful tracers and that larger tracer sets have an enhanced capacity to avoid false conclusions about catchment functioning. The presented approach produces results that may not be apparent from the traditional approach and it is a first step to add the idea of statistical significance to the EMMA approach.},

Here this model is extended to include the effects of inhibition. Experimental data are presented on the various factors which enhance and inhibit the nonreductive dissolution and the reductive dissolution (by H2S) of various Fe(III)(hydr) oxides ({$\alpha$}-Fe2O3, {$\alpha$}-FeOOH, and {$\gamma$}-FeOOH). The effects observed with iron oxides are similar to those expected to occur with other oxide and aluminumsilicate minerals. Special attention is paid to the effects of changes in surface protonation brought on by the binding of cations and anions to the surface. Binuclear surface complexes, especially those formed by the adsorption of oxoanions such as phosphate, arsenate, borate, and sulfate, are particularly good at inhibiting both the reductive and nonreductive dissolutions of a reference system of iron (III) oxides. This phenomenon is due to (1) the large activation energy which must be overcome to simultaneously detach two surface metal centers and to (2) the lack of additional surface protonation when uncharged binuclear or multinuclear complexes are formed.},

This latter is the result of a number of transport, microbial and chemical processes. The role of P in the productivity in systems and in the eutrophication process has initiated a large number of studies to the behaviour of P in sediments. Case studies in Veluwemeer, IJsselmeer, Wadden Sea and German Bight show that sorption on and binding in ferric (oxi)hydroxides, occlusion in calcium carbonates and authigenic mineral formation are the most important retention processes. However, all this research did not result in totally new approaches in lake restoration, nor did knowledge of internal P loading result in large scale applications of well-known sediment restoration techniques. It did result in more realistic expectations of lake restoration programmes. At the same time, renewed interest in the overall role of phosphate in the functioning and productivity of systems is emerging. The most important new items are: the role of the productivity is examined at large scale levels; the coupling of productivity with several large scale material cycles and global environmental problems and the study of the behaviour and fate of phosphate within the context of the functioning of entire watersheds.},

  abstract = {Sediment-water fluxes are influenced by both hydrodynamics and sediment biogeochemical processes. However, fluxes at the sediment-water interface (SWI) are almost always analyzed from either a water- or sediment-side perspective. This study expands on previous work by comparing water-side (hydrodynamics and resulting diffusive boundary layer thickness, {$\delta$}               DBL               ) and sediment-side (oxygen consumption and resulting sediment oxic zone) approaches for evaluating diffusive sediment oxygen uptake rate (J               O2               ) and {$\delta$}               DBL               from microprofiles. Dissolved oxygen microprofile and current velocity data were analyzed using five common methods to estimate J               O2               and {$\delta$}               DBL               and to assess the robustness of the approaches. Comparable values for J               O2               and {$\delta$}               DBL               were obtained (agreement within 20\%), and turbulence-induced variations in these parameters were uniformly characterized with the five methods. J               O2               estimates based on water-side data were consistently higher (+1.8 mmol m               -2               d               -1               or 25\% on average) and {$\delta$}               DBL               estimates correspondingly lower (-0.4 mm or 35\% on average) than those obtained using sediment-side data. This deviation may be attributed to definition of the sediment-water interface location, artifacts of the methods themselves, assumptions made on sediment properties, and/or variability in sediment oxygen-uptake processes. Our work emphasizes that sediment-side microprofile data may more accurately describe oxygen uptake at a particular location, whereas water-side data are representative of oxygen uptake over a broader sediment area. Regardless, our overall results show clearly that estimates of J               O2               and {$\delta$}               DBL               are not strongly dependent on the method chosen for analysis.},

  abstract = {Lac Pavin is a crater lake, characterized by water column stratification, with oxygenated shallow waters lying above anoxic and ferruginous deep waters. In the deep waters, ferrous iron, Fe(II)aq, is the main dissolved cation, with concentrations up to 1 mM. Iron is efficiently confined below the oxic-anoxic boundary due to the formation of insoluble ferric iron species, Fe(III)s, by oxidation with O2 and other oxidants (e.g., NO3-, Mn(IV)). The Fe(III)s particles settle down and are reduced in the anoxic waters and at the lake bottom by reaction with organic matter to soluble Fe(II)aq. It then diffuses upward in the water column and finally is re-oxidized to Fe(III) at the redox boundary. This process, known as the ``iron wheel'', is described in the present paper that reviews available data for dissolved and particulate matter in the water column, settling particles collected by sediment traps and sediment cores. Detailed analyses for some major and trace element concentrations, along with iron speciation and isotope composition, high-resolution microscopy, and geochemical modeling provide a picture of biogeochemical cycling in this Fe-rich aqueous system. At Lac Pavin the P and Fe cycles are tightly coupled. Orthophosphate is sorbed onto Fe oxyhydroxides and/or precipitated as Fe(II)-Fe(III)-phosphates at the redox interface, confining P ions in the deep anoxic waters. Deeper in the water column, particulate Fe concentrations progressively increase due to Fe(II) phosphate (vivianite) formation.

  abstract = {During summer stratification large amounts of phosphorus (P) accumulate in anoxic bottom waters of many lakes due to release of P from underlying sediments. The availability to phytoplankton of this P is inversely related to the Fe:P ratio in bottom waters. Using data from 51 lakes, we tested the hypothesis that sulfate concentration in lake water may be critical in controlling the Fe:P ratio in anoxic bottom waters. Results showed that Fe:P ratios in bottom waters of lakes were significantly (p {$<$} 0.001) related to surface water sulfate concentrations. The higher Fe:P ratios in low sulfate systems is due not only to higher iron concentrations in anoxic bottom waters but also to lower P concentrations in anoxic waters. Thus, our results suggest that anthropogenically induced increases in sulfate concentrations of waters (e.g. from fossil fuel burning) may have a double effect on P cycling in lakes. Higher sulfate concentrations can both increase the magnitude of P release from sediments as well as increase the availability of P released from sediments into anoxic bottom waters.},

Coupled Fe/S cycling processes can influence the mobilization of phosphorus (P) in sediments, with high releases often resulting in eutrophication. To better understand eutrophication in Lake Taihu (PRC), we investigated the effects of CBB and temperature on phosphorus cycling in lake sediments. Results indicated that added CBB not only enhanced sedimentary iron reduction, but also resulted in a change from net sulfur oxidation to sulfate reduction, which jointly resulted in a spike of soluble Fe(II) and the formation of FeS/FeS2. Phosphate release was also enhanced with CBB amendment along with increases in reduced sulfur. Further release of phosphate was associated with increases in incubation temperature. In addition, CBB amendment resulted in a shift in P from the Fe-adsorbed P and the relatively unreactive Residual-P pools to the more reactive Al-adsorbed P, Ca-bound P and organic-P pools. Phosphorus cycling rates increased on addition of CBB and were higher at elevated temperatures, resulting in increased phosphorus release from sediments. These findings suggest that settling of CBB into sediments will likely increase the extent of eutrophication in aquatic environments and these processes will be magnified at higher temperatures.},

  abstract = {Increasing sulfate input has been seen as an issue in management of aquatic ecosystems, but its influences on eutrophic freshwater lakes is not clear. In this study, it was observed that increasing sulfate concentration without additional cyanobacterial bloom biomass (CBB) addition did not have an obvious effect on element cycling during 1-year continuous flow mesocosm experiments in which water and sediments were taken from a shallow eutrophic lake with sulfate levels near 1 mM. However, following addition of CBB to mesocosms, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were observed in the water column, and increasing numbers of SRB in the water column were associated with higher sulfate input. Sulfate amendment (0e70 mg L{\`A}1) also resulted in a larger amount of total dissolved sulfide (peak values of 5.90 {\textpm} 0.36 to 7.60 {\textpm} 0.12 mg L{\`A}1) in the water column and acid volatile sulfide (1081.71 {\textpm} 69.91 to 1557.98 {\textpm} 41.72 mg kg{\`A}1) in 0e1 cm surface sediments due to sulfate reduction. During the period of CBB decomposition, increasing sulfate levels in the water column were positively correlated with increasing diffusive phosphate fluxes of 1.23 {\textpm} 0.32 to 2.17 {\textpm} 0.01 mg m{\`A}2 d{\`A}1 at the water-sediment interface. As increases in sulfide and phosphate release rates deteriorated the water quality/ecosystem and even spurred the occurrence of a black water problem in lakes, the control of sulfate input level should be considered for shallow eutrophic lake management, especially during cyanobacterial bloom periods.},

We analysed 35~years of data for the time TP concentrations took to decline from\,{$\approx$}\,700 to 20--30~{\textmu}g/l, biota to respond and cyanobacteria to become negligible. The internal load proved of minor relevance. After 10~years, TP reached 35--40~{\textmu}g/l, phytoplankton biomass abruptly declined by 50\% and cyanobacteria no longer dominated; yet 10~years later at TP\,{$<$}\,20--30~{\textmu}g/l they were below quantifiable levels. 20--25~years after load reduction, the lake was stably mesotrophic, macrophytes had returned down to 6--8~m, and vivianite now forms, binding P insolubly in the sediment. Bottom-up control of phytoplankton through TP proved decisive. Five intermittent years with a higher external P load caused some `re-eutrophication', delaying recovery by 5 years. While some restoration responses required undercutting thresholds, particularly that of phytoplankton biomass to TP, resilience and hysteresis proved irrelevant. Future research needs to focus on the littoral zone, and for predicting time spans for recovery more generally, meta-analyses should address P load reduction in combination with flushing rates.},

  abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for all life forms. It is a mineral nutrient. Orthophosphate is the only form of P that autotrophs can assimilate. Extracellular enzymes hydrolyze organic forms of P to phosphate. Eutrophication is the overenrichment of receiving waters with mineral nutrients. The results are excessive production of autotrophs, especially algae and cyanobacteria. This high productivity leads to high bacterial populations and high respiration rates, leading to hypoxia or anoxia in poorly mixed bottom waters and at night in surface waters during calm, warm conditions. Low dissolved oxygen causes the loss of aquatic animals and release of many materials normally bound to bottom sediments including various forms of P. This release of P reinforces the eutrophication. Excessive concentrations of P is the most common cause of eutrophication in freshwater lakes, reservoirs, streams, and headwaters of estuarine systems. In the ocean, N becomes the key mineral nutrient controlling primary production. Estuaries and continental shelf waters are a transition zone, where excessive P and N create problems. It is best to measure and regulate total P inputs to whole aquatic ecosystems, but for an easy assay it is best to measure total P concentrations, including paniculate P, in surface waters or N/P atomic ratios in phytoplankton.},

In this paper, experimental results concerning the phosphorus (P) precipitation by iron application are reported. First, preliminary studies were conducted serving the choice of an appropriate precipitant. Subsequently, a whole-lake experiment was carried out. Fe2+ salts displayed a delayed oxidation and flocculation behaviour when injected into an ascending water jet. Nevertheless, the efficiency of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) elimination was equal to experiments with Fe3+ compounds both in laboratory and field experiments. During Fe2+ application, a large P-binding potential remained during the horizontal spreading of the treated water, since the proportion of the dissolved iron fraction near the dosage point was still high. Thus, measurements at a greater distance from the dosage point revealed higher amounts of P eliminated by Fe2+ than by Fe3+ dosage. Compared to the preceding year 1995, during the treatment periods in May--August 1996 and 1997 the SRP contents in the whole water body dropped by 72\% and 54\%, respectively, while the total phosphorus contents dropped by 45\% at each period. We conclude that in-lake dosage of Fe2+ is an appropriate method to reduce the P loading of hypereutrophic reservoirs.},

  abstract = {Pyrite, or iron disulfide, is the most common sulfide mineral on the Earth's surface and is widespread through the geological record. Because sulfides are mainly produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in modern sedimentary environments, microorganisms are assumed to drive the formation of iron sulfides, in particular, pyrite. However, the exact role played by microorganisms in pyrite formation remains unclear and, to date, the precipitation of pyrite in microbial cultures has only rarely been achieved. The present work relies on chemical monitoring, electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and synchrotron-based spectroscopy to evaluate the formation of iron sulfides by the sulfate-reducing bacteria Desulfovibrio desulfuricans as a function of the source of iron, either provided as dissolved Fe2+ or as FeIII-phosphate nanoparticles. Dissolved ferrous iron led to the formation of increasingly crystalline mackinawite (FeS) with time, encrusting bacterial cell walls, hence preventing further sulfate reduction upon day 5 and any evolution of iron sulfides into more stable phases, e.g., pyrite. In contrast, ferric phosphate was transformed into a mixture of large flattened crystals of well-crystallized vivianite (Fe3(PO4)2{$\cdot$}8H2O) and a biofilm-like thin film of poorly crystallized mackinawite. Although being hosted in the iron sulfide biofilm, most cells were not encrusted. Excess sulfide delivered by the bacteria and oxidants (such as polysulfides) promoted the evolution of mackinawite into greigite (Fe3S4) and the nucleation of pyrite spherules. These spherules were several hundreds of nanometers wide and occurred within the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) of the biofilm after only 1 month. Altogether, the present study demonstrates that the mineral assemblage induced by the metabolic activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria strongly depends on the source of iron, which has strong implications for the interpretation of the presence of pyrite and vivianite in natural environments.},

  abstract = {A novel method was used to examine the microbial ecology of iron-rich wetland sediments receiving neutral-pH coal mine drainage. Gel probes inserted into the sediments allowed analysis of the distribution and activity of bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR). A mixed population of sulfate-reducing bacteria enriched from anoxic wetland sediments was immobilized in low temperature-gelling agarose held in grooved rods or probes. The probes were inserted vertically into sediments and were allowed to incubate in situ for 48 h. After their retrieval, the gels were sectioned and analyzed for residual BSR activity and were compared to in situ BSR rates and chemical porewater profiles. The depth distribution of residual BSR activity in the immobilized cell gel probes differed significantly from the BSR measured in situ. Approximately 51\% of the total integrated residual sulfate reduction activity measured in the gel probes occurred between 0 and 7 cm of the upper 20 cm of sediment. In contrast, ca. 99\% of the integrated in situ BSR occurred between 7- and 20-cm depth, and only 1\% of the total integrated rate occurred between 0- and 7-cm depth. Lactate-enriched bacteria immobilized in the gel may have been atypical of the majority of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the sediment. Agarose-immobilized sulfate-reducing bacteria might also be able to proliferate in the otherwise inhospitable zone of iron reduction, where sulfate and labile carbon compounds for which they are usually outcompeted can diffuse freely into the gel matrix. Gel probes containing particulate iron monosulfide (FeS) indicated that FeS remained stable in sediments at depths greater than 2 to 3 cm below the sediment--water interface, consistent with the shallow penetration of oxygen into surface sediments.},

  abstract = {Aluminum, one of the most abundant elements in soils and sediments, is commonly found co-precipitated with Fe in natural Fe(III) (hydr)oxides; yet, little is known about how Al substitution impacts bacterial Fe(III) reduction. Accordingly, we investigated the reduction of Al substituted (0--13mol\% Al) goethite, lepidocrocite, and ferrihydrite by the model dissimilatory Fe(III)-reducing bacterium (DIRB), Shewanella putrefaciens CN32. Here we reveal that the impact of Al on microbial reduction varies with Fe(III) (hydr)oxide type. No significant difference in Fe(III) reduction was observed for either goethite or lepidocrocite as a function of Al substitution. In contrast, Fe(III) reduction rates significantly decreased with increasing Al substitution of ferrihydrite, with reduction rates of 13\% Al-ferrihydrite more than 50\% lower than pure ferrihydrite. Although Al substitution changed the minerals' surface area, particle size, structural disorder, and abiotic dissolution rates, we did not observe a direct correlation between any of these physiochemical properties and the trends in bacterial Fe(III) reduction. Based on projected Al-dependent Fe(III) reduction rates, reduction rates of ferrihydrite fall below those of lepidocrocite and goethite at substitution levels equal to or greater than 18mol\% Al. Given the prevalence of Al substitution in natural Fe(III) (hydr)oxides, our results bring into question the conventional assumptions about Fe (hydr)oxide bioavailability and suggest a more prominent role of natural lepidocrocite and goethite phases in impacting DIRB activity in soils and sediments.},

Candidatus Accumulibacter conform to the classical physiology model for polyphosphate accumulating organisms and are widely believed to be the most important player for the process in full-scale EBPR systems. However, it was impossible till now to quantify the contribution of specific microbial clades to EBPR. In this study, we have developed a new tool to directly link the identity of microbial cells to the absolute quantification of intracellular poly-P and other polymers under in situ conditions, and applied it to eight full-scale EBPR plants. Besides Ca. Accumulibacter, members of the genus Tetrasphaera were found to be important microbes for P accumulation, and in six plants they were the most important. As these Tetrasphaera cells did not exhibit the classical phenotype of poly-P accumulating microbes, our entire understanding of the microbiology of the EBPR process has to be revised. Furthermore, our new single-cell approach can now also be applied to quantify storage polymer dynamics in individual populations in situ in other ecosystems and might become a valuable tool for many environmental microbiologists.},

  abstract = {In order to improve the trophic state of Lake Sempach, a eutrophied lake in central Switzerland, its external phosphorus (P) load has been decreased and its hypolimnion has been artificially oxygenated to lower the lake-internal P recycling. Based on more than 15 yr of experience, we conclude that the reduction of the external P load resulted in a corresponding decrease of the lake's P concentration. However, contrary to initial expectations, increased hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentrations neither (1) reduced the P release from sediments during summer nor (2) resulted in anincreased permanent P retention. These observations warrant a reevaluation of the well-accepted management strategy of decreasing the lake internal P cycling by maintaining an aerobic hypolimnion and sediment surface. We hypothesize that oxygenation only results in an increased permanent benthic P burial if, because of the depressed sulfide production, more ferrous phosphate (e.g., vivianite) and less FeS is deposited in the anoxic sediment. Hence, it is not the oxic sediment surface that directly affects the permanent redox-dependent sediment P retention but the molar ratio of the available reactive Fe(II) : S2- : PO4 in the anoxic sediment. This ratio is driven by the settling rate and the nature of organic matter and particulate iron, as well as the supply of oxygen, nitrate, and sulfate to the sediment.},

Throughout the Arendsee's depth of up to 50 meters, there is an unrestricted exchange of water with the underlying groundwater. This comes from a catchment area of 31 km{$^2$} without sustaining separating layers. The groundwater flows into the lake from the south and leaves after about 61 years to the north. The Arendsee's high chemical load of phosphor (annual average 183 {\textmu}g/l TP in 2015) results from historical inputs over an extended period. The source was always domestic wastewater from septic tanks, sewage farms or storage ponds. This water reaches the lake primary across surface flow paths with different dwelling periods and without significant substance reduction. The known and, compared with the relevant literature, extremely high P-pollution of the near-surface groundwater from the southern inflow into the Arendsee (up to 5 mg/l o-PO4-P) under the city center can be clearly confirmed. Additional sediment analyses of the aquifer show a greater load, which, due to the retardation of phosphor in the soil skeleton, will probably lead to a pollution in the further groundwater downstream under the city for many decades. Significant result of the studies is the clearly lower current phosphor loads reaching the Arendsee over the environmental media (atmospheric input, geese, surface water, groundwater and other sources).},

  abstract = {Our understanding of geochemical processes in sediments and soils has been limited by a lack of simple procedures to measure the kinetics of transfer from solid phase to solution. Diffusive Gradients in Thin-films (DGT) is an in situ technique which can be used to measure porewater concentrations and remobilisation fluxes of trace-metals, in sediments and soils. The dynamics of the sediment/DGT system were investigated using two dimensional modelling to ensure the correct interpretation of DGT measured fluxes, investigate the kinetics of the resupply from metal sorbed to particles, and estimate the magnitude of the resupply from particles to porewater in volumetric terms. When porewater concentrations adjacent to the DGT device are maintained by fast resupply from a large reservoir of metal sorbed to the solid phase (the sustained case), DGT measurements can be interpreted directly as porewater concentrations. When there is significant resupply from the solid phase, DGT can be used to measure kinetic parameters. If porewater concentrations are measured independently by an alternative technique, DGT measurements can be expressed in terms of a ratio R of DGT estimated to actual porewater concentration (0 {$<$} R {$<$} 1). Our model predicts a relationship between R, the kinetics of the resupply process, and the available reservoir of sorbed metal (expressed as a Kd value). If, as found previously for Cd and Zn in sediments, R {$\geq$} 0.95, the response time (Tc) of the (de)sorption process must be {$\leq$}0.8 s and Kd (the distribution coefficient between solid and dissolved metal) must be {$\geq$}1.1 {\texttimes} 105 cm3 g-1. For any measured value of R, Tc can be estimated either precisely or within limits, depending on what is known about Kd. Published DGT measurements for Cu and Fe lead us to estimate response times for the sorption process of 30 mins and 19 mins. If Kd is known precisely, the apparent 1st order rate constants for the sorption process can be determined. Multiple DGT deployments with varying diffusion layer thicknesses can be used to estimate porewater concentrations. The DGT device depletes the reservoir of available metal sorbed to the solid phase. This depletion decreases with distance from the device. A simple relationship was developed to estimate, from the DGT measured flux, the mass of metal released from unit volume of particles.},

Fe-bound P (i.e., citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite (CDB)-extractable P) was the most dynamic fraction of PP, dominating oligohaline (salinity {$<$}3) sediments, but declining to near zero with depth in the most saline sediments of all three subestuaries. In contrast, we previously found Fe-P dominating the sediment PP at salinities ranging 0--11 in the Patuxent subestuary. Particulate organic P was relatively constant with depth and salinity and became the dominant form of PP in the most saline sediments. Fe-P was not replaced with diagenetic authigenic carbonate fluorapatite. In all the subestuaries, Fe-P generally persisted in the oligohaline sediments to 1~m depth, where sediment ages ranged from 60 to 200~years, based on 210Pb dating. At one site, PP burial reflected changing P loads from a nearby wastewater treatment plant. About 67\% of the PP discharged from the Potomac watershed at the head of tide was buried in the sediments in the upper reaches of that subestuary. The form and amount of PP buried depended on the amount of CDB-extractable Fe in the sediments and on the distribution of sediment deposition along the salinity gradient. Even though CDB targets iron oxides, the predominant form of Fe in the sediments was ferrous iron suggesting that the predominant form of PP in oligohaline sediments may be ferrous phosphate.},

  abstract = {Sulfate reduction and sulfur--iron geochemistry were studied in 5--6 m deep gravity cores of Holocene mud from Aarhus Bay (Denmark). A goal was to understand whether sulfate is generated by re-oxidation of sulfide throughout the sulfate and methane zones, which might explain the abundance of active sulfate reducers deep below the main sulfate zone. Sulfate penetrated down to 130 cm where methane started to build up and where the concentration of free sulfide peaked at 5.5 mM. Below this sulfate--methane transition, sulfide diffused downwards to a sulfidization front at 520 cm depth, below which dissolved iron, Fe2+, accumulated in the pore water. Sulfate reduction rates measured by 35S-tracer incubations in the sulfate zone were high due to high concentrations of reactive organic matter. Within the sulfate--methane transition, sulfate reduction was distinctly stimulated by the anaerobic oxidation of methane. In the methane zone below, sulfate remained at positive ``background'' concentrations of {$<$}0.5 mM down to the sulfidization front. Sulfate reduction decreased steeply to rates which at 300--500 cm depth were 0.2--1 pmol SO42- cm-3 d-1, i.e., 4--5 orders of magnitude lower than rates measured near the sediment surface. The turn-over time of sulfate increased from 3 years at 12 cm depth to 100--1000 years down in the methane zone. Sulfate reduction in the methane zone accounted for only 0.1\% of sulfate reduction in the entire sediment column and was apparently limited by the low pore water concentration of sulfate and the low availability of organic substrates. Amendment of the sediment with both sulfate and organic substrates immediately caused a 10- to 40-fold higher, ``potential sulfate reduction'' which showed that a physiologically intact community of sulfate reducing bacteria was present. The ``background'' sulfate concentration appears to be generated from the reaction of downwards diffusing sulfide with deeply buried Fe(III) species, such as poorly-reactive iron oxides or iron bound in reactive silicates. The oxidation of sulfide to sulfate in the sulfidic sediment may involve the formation of elemental sulfur and thiosulfate and their further disproportionation to sulfide and sulfate. The net reaction of sulfide and Fe(III) to form pyrite requires an additional oxidant, irrespective of the formation of sulfate. This could be CO2 which is reduced with H2 to methane. The methane subsequently diffuses upwards to become re-oxidized at the sulfate--methane transition and thereby removes excess reducing power and enables the formation of excess sulfate. We show here how the combination of these well-established sulfur--iron--carbon reactions may lead to the deep formation of sulfate and drive a cryptic sulfur cycle. The iron-rich post-glacial sediments underlying Holocene marine mud stimulate the strong sub-surface sulfide reoxidation observed in Aarhus Bay and are a result of the glacial to interglacial history of the Baltic Sea area. Yet, processes similar to the ones described here probably occur widespread in marine sediments, in particular along the ocean margins.},

As demonstrated with sediments of Lake Petersdorf, benthic organisms can also contribute to the formation of polyߚP (up to 0.11 mg P [g dry weight]ߚ1) under favorable aerobic conditions. PolyߚP is more rapidly transformed into single orthophosphate during diagenesis than other inorganic and organic P species. The transformation of organic P compounds and polyߚP can contribute significantly to the release of P during diagenesis and should be considered along with the reductive dissolution of P sorbed to iron oxihydroxides.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Microbial dissimilatory sulfate reduction to sulfide is a predominant terminal pathway of organic matter mineralization in the anoxic seabed. Chemical or microbial oxidation of the produced sulfide establishes a complex network of pathways in the sulfur cycle, leading to intermediate sulfur species and partly back to sulfate. The intermediates include elemental sulfur, polysulfides, thiosulfate, and sulfite, which are all substrates for further microbial oxidation, reduction or disproportionation. New microbiological discoveries, such as long-distance electron transfer through sulfide oxidizing cable bacteria, add to the complexity. Isotope exchange reactions play an important role for the stable isotope geochemistry and for the experimental study of sulfur transformations using radiotracers. Microbially catalyzed processes are partly reversible whereby the back-reaction affects our interpretation of radiotracer experiments and provides a mechanism for isotope fractionation. We here review the progress and current status in our understanding of the sulfur cycle in the seabed with respect to its microbial ecology, biogeochemistry, and isotope geochemistry.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The chemical forms of phosphorus (P) in sediments are routinely measured in studies of P in modern and ancient marine environments. However, samples for such analyses are often exposed to atmospheric oxygen during storage and handling. Recent work suggests that long-term exposure of pyrite-bearing sediments can lead to a decline in apatite P and an increase in ferric Fe-bound P. Here, we report on alterations in P speciation in reducing modern Baltic Sea sediments that we deliberately exposed to atmospheric oxygen for a period of either one week or one year. During oxidation of the sediment, extensive changes occurred in all measured P reservoirs. Exchangeable P all but disappeared during the first week of exposure, likely reflecting adsorption of porewater PO4 by Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides (i.e. ferric Fe-bound P formation). Detrital and organic P were also rapidly affected: decreases in both reservoirs were already observed after the first week of exposure to atmospheric oxygen. This was likely because of acidic dissolution of detrital apatite and oxidation of organic matter, respectively. These processes produced dissolved PO4 that was then scavenged by Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides. Interestingly, P in authigenic calcium phosphates (i.e. apatite: authigenic Ca-P) remained unaffected after the first week of exposure, which we attributed to the shielding effect of microfossils in which authigenic Ca-P occurs in Baltic Sea sediments. This effect was transient; a marked decrease in the authigenic Ca-P pool was observed in the sediments after one year of exposure to oxygen. In summary, we show that handling and storage of wet sediments under oxic conditions can lead to rapid and extensive alteration of the original sediment P speciation.},

  abstract = {Iron (Fe) cycling exerts strong control on the mobility and bioavailability of the key nutrient phosphate (PO4) in soils and sediments. Coprecipitation of PO4 is known to alter the structure of Fe (oxyhydr)oxides (FeOx), however the environmental fate of PO4-bearing FeOx is not well-understood. Here, PO4-bearing FeOx with 9~mol\% coprecipitated PO4 were prepared by Fe(III) hydrolysis and Fe(II) oxidation in the presence of dissolved PO4, in addition to pure FeOx synthesized in PO4-free solutions. The pure and PO4-bearing FeOx were subsequently exposed to different concentrations of dissolved Fe(II) and sulfide (2 and 10~mmol L-1). Mineral transformations and the fate of PO4 were tracked over 7--14~days with wet chemical techniques (including sequential Fe and S extraction) and synchrotron-based Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Coprecipitation of PO4 affected the rate and extent of FeOx transformation differently for Fe(II) and sulfide. Poorly-ordered PO4-bearing FeOx was preserved in the presence of dissolved Fe(II) while pure ferrihydrite was nearly completely transformed into goethite over 7~days. By contrast, coprecipitation of PO4 rendered FeOx more reactive towards sulfide compared to pure FeOx. Reaction with dissolved sulfide resulted in the formation of non-sulfidized Fe(II) or Fe(II) sulfide under high and low Fe/sulfide ratio, respectively. Under low Fe/sulfide ratio, Fh and PO4-bearing, poorly-ordered FeOx were nearly completely sulfidized after 14~days. Sulfidation of FeOx led to efficient release of PO4 into solution, and at low Fe/sulfide ratio more PO4 was released than expected based on the extent of Fe sulfidation. The results suggest feedback mechanisms of environmental relevance: coprecipitation of strongly-sorbing species such as PO4 disrupts FeOx structure, which affects FeOx reactivity and the overall nutrient or contaminant retention capacity of soils or sediments differently depending on the ambient redox conditions. Specifically, the switch from reducing to sulfidic conditions may be associated with the disproportionate release of nutrients and contaminants.},

  abstract = {Much of the controversy in the microbial vs. non-microbial phosphorite debate results from a lack of rigor in defining the specific levels at which microbial activity intervenes in phosphogenesis. A clear distinction between the processes that control the sedimentary transformations of particulate phosphorus fractions and the processes that directly participate in the apatite precipitation reaction seems to be necessary in order to reconcile the conflicting views. Microbial processes are the primary driving force behind the transformation of deposited particulate phosphorus into dissolved phosphate, a critical first step in the formation of apatite. The precipitation of apatite itself, however, is widely controlled by kinetic factors. Depending on the initial degree of supersaturation of pore solutions, different mechanisms of the precipitation reaction may prevail in sediments. In most continental margin sediments, low to moderate concentrations of dissolved phosphate may result in a direct nucleation of apatite crystals, leading to a slow formation of dispersed apatite in the sediment column. In phosphogenic sediments, high localized rates of dissolved phosphate generation promote the fast nucleation of a metastable precursor of apatite. This creates a large number of crystallization sites in the sediment, and results in the rapid formation of phosphatic bodies. The transitory fixation and release of phosphate by microbial communities may be responsible, in part, for the elevated concentrations of dissolved pore phosphate observed in close proximity to the water-sediment interface at sites of present-day phosphorite formation (e. g. sediments on the Peru-Chile shelf). Localized pulses of high supersaturation enhance the likelihood of rapid apatite deposition close to the water-sediment interface. Microbial redox processes may further help focusing the rapid precipitation of apatite in the interface environment by telescoping chemical gradients and associated pH shifts in the surface sediment layer. There is no convincing evidence of other important microbial effects being directly involved in the formation of apatite in marine sediments, for instance intra-cellular precipitation of calcium phosphate. A close association of benthic microbial activity and the formation of apatite can be widely traced in ancient phosphogenic environments. The organic matter of fossil phosphorites preserves a clear molecular signature of the intense degradation of sedimentary organic matter at the seafloor, and points to liberation of phosphorus from organic compounds as a predominant microbial process involved in apatite formation. Ultrastructure analysis of microbial fabrics preserved in phosphorites permits the identification of abundant and di{\textlnot} verse benthic microbial communities. Extracellular precipitation of apatite was a common mechanism of microbiota preservation, although no direct cellular control of apatite precipitation can be inferred. The development of localized phosphatic bodies in many ancient phosphorites is likely to reflect the spatial association between the activity of individualized benthic microbial communities and the precipitation of apatite. Stromatolitic phosphorites provide an extreme example of such an association.},

  abstract = {Vivianite, a ferrous phosphate mineral, can be an important phosphorus (P) sink in non-sulfidic, reducing coastal sediments. The Fe in the crystal structure of vivianite can be substituted by other divalent metal cations such as Mn2+ or Mg2+. Since Mg is much more abundant in coastal porewaters than Mn, the more frequent reports of Mn substitution in vivianites of coastal sediments has been suggested to indicate a preferential incorporation of Mn over Mg into the crystal structure of vivianite. However, although both Mn and Mg substitution in vivianite are environmentally relevant, it is yet unknown whether Mn or Mg is preferentially incorporated and how these isomorphic substitutions alter the crystal structure and morphology of vivianite, parameters which may influence vivianite reactivity. Here, we studied the incorporation of Mn and/or Mg in vivianites formed by co-precipitation at pH 7 in the presence of varying dissolved Mn and/or Mg concentrations and solution salinities resembling an estuarine gradient from 0 to 9 psu. In total, 19 different vivianites were synthesized, with up to 50\% of Fe substituted by Mn and Mg. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations showed that aqueous Mg speciation was altered with increasing salinity, while Mn speciation was less affected, likely explaining the preferential incorporation of Mn in the vivianite structure at higher salinities. 57Fe-M{\"o}ssbauer spectroscopy revealed that both Mn and Mg were preferentially incorporated in the double-octahedral Fe position, at which intervalence charge transfer is possible during the oxidation of vivianite. In contrast to Mg, which is redox inactive, incorporated Mn can participate in heteronuclear intervalence charge transfer with Fe. Thus, incorporation of either cation may impact the reactivity of vivianite under oxidizing conditions in element specific ways. Results of complementary analyses including X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy further showed that incorporation of Mn and/or Mg led to smaller particle size, increased crystal roughness and thinner crystals, as well as systematic changes in unit cell parameters. These observed changes in crystal morphology might impact the reactivity of vivianite in natural environments and thus the effect of cation incorporation in vivianite should be considered when studying Fe and P cycling in coastal sediments.},

  abstract = {Vivianite, a ferrous phosphate mineral, can be a significant phosphorus (P) burial phase in non-sulfidic, reducing coastal sediments. Expected sea level rise may increase sulfide production in currently non-sulfidic sediments containing vivianite, leading to conditions under which vivianite is thermodynamically unstable. Here, we compared the mineral transformation processes of two different vivianites: unsubstituted vivianite and a vivianite substituted with Mn and Mg (Mn/Mg/Fe=0.30/0.14/0.56), two cations that frequently substitute for Fe in the crystal structure of vivianite. Further, we investigated the potential role of calcium carbonate as a sorption site for phosphate, which is released during vivianite dissolution. The vivianites were mixed with sea sand (quartz) and with or without calcium carbonate. The mixes were filled in mesh bags and installed at 15 to 20 cm sediment depth at two adjacent field plots with contrasting dissolved sulfide concentrations in an intertidal flat in the Wadden Sea. The low sulfide plot had sulfide concentrations {$\leq$}50 {$\mu$}M, while concentrations at the high sulfide plot ranged from 0.6 to 6.7 mM. Porewater chemistry was regularly monitored during the field experiment. After 56 days of field incubation, the reacted solid phase was assessed by acid digestion for total elemental composition and Fe, P, and S speciation by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Both vivianites with and without calcium carbonate and at both field plots dissolved partially, resulting in a net loss of Fe, Mn, Mg, and P from the mesh bags (elemental losses ranged from {$\sim$} 10 to 35\%), while solid-phase S accumulated, particularly at the high sulfide plot. Green rust minerals were the major transformation product at the low sulfide plot to which some released phosphate could likely readsorb. Mackinawite formation, which dominated at the high sulfide plot, is less efficient at adsorbing P and thus resulted in an enhanced P loss from the mesh bags. On average, there was {$\sim$} 27\% P loss at the high sulfide plot, compared to {$\sim$} 20\% at the low sulfide plot. Mn-Mg-substituted vivianite dissolved more at both field plots, likely due to changes in mineral reactivity due to isomorphic substitution. The presence of calcium carbonate slightly lowered P loss, suggesting that its presence may positively impact P retention during vivianite transformation. Overall, P availability was enhanced under euxinic conditions, indicating that vivianite-containing sediments may become sources of bioavailable P under changing environmental conditions.},

Sulfate reduction, normally playing a modest role in these systems, becomes the most important biogeochemical process, inducing severe eutrophication and sulfide toxicity. In field enclosure experiments we observed striking differences between the responses of two freshwater marshes to sulfate. On one location sulfate addition resulted in strong phosphorus mobilization without sulfide accumulation, whereas high sediment sulfide concentrations, known to be toxic to wetland macrophytes, were reached in the other marsh without eutrophication occurring. The results could be explained by differences in groundwater iron discharge and nutrient contents of the peat sediments. Sulfate reduction rates appeared to be limited by either electron donor availability (first marsh) or electron acceptor availability (second marsh). The implications of these findings are explained in relation to freshwater wetland management.},

  abstract = {Despite the ecological significance of microbial iron and sulphate reduction in aquatic environments, the processes involved have been poorly studied in Baltic Sea sediments. On the basis of indirect evidence, we conclude that the bottom sediments of the non-stratified and oligotrophic northernmost, and the poorly stratified and mesotrophic next northern, subbasins of the Baltic have tolerated the external nutrient load rather well, as they are still in a state in which iron reduction and coupled cycling of iron and phosphorus prevail in the surface sediments. Since iron-reducing bacteria are unable to reduce ferric oxides completely, part of the iron-bound phosphorus may be permanently buried in the sediments. The good ability of the sediment to retain phosphorus results in low concentrations of phosphorus in water, a state that in turn promotes phosphorus limitation of primary production. In contrast, the sediments of the nutrient-loaded and stratified sub-basins, the Gulf of Finland (the most eutrophied subbasin) and the Baltic Proper, appeared to have reached a state in which sulphate reduction is the dominant mineralisation pathway. Sulphate reduction followed by sulphide formation leads to efficient reduction of ferric oxides. Subsequently, iron-bound phosphorus dissolves into the pore water and is transported to the overlying water, whereas iron is buried as sulphides (uncoupled iron and phosphorus cycling). The capacity of sediments to retain phosphorus is limited; high amounts of bioavailable phosphate exist in the water column, primary production tends to be nitrogen limited and extensive blue-green algal blooms are common. We maintain that the decisive factors controlling the above regional distribution of iron and sulphate reduction are the flux of labile organic matter to the sediments and the variation in hydrodynamics. Sulphate reduction will be triggered when the flux of organic matter reaches a critical threshold value, resulting in anoxia at the sediment--water interface, followed by the collapse of benthic fauna and inhibition of iron re-oxidation. The only way to drive the sediments back into an iron-reduced state is to strongly reduce bioavailable nitrogen and phosphorus loading to the Baltic Sea, and thus the flux of labile organic matter to the sediments. Even so, recovery may also necessitate favourable hydrodynamic conditions.},

Understanding the mechanisms of P release from sediments should help to restore water quality. This study used the diffusive gradients in thin film (DGT) technique to investigate the seasonal variation in the lability, remobilization mechanisms, and release characteristics of sediment P in the uncontaminated Xizhi River and the severely contaminated Danshui River, South China. P accumulation in sediments contributed to higher DGT-labile P concentrations in contaminated reaches, and the highest labile P concentrations were generally observed in summer season at each site. The significant positive relationships (p {$<$} 0.05) between labile Fe and P confirmed the FeeP coupling release mechanism in uncontaminated sediments. Stronger relationships between labile Mn and P at contaminated sites indicated that Mn oxides played an important role in P remobilization. However, sulfate reduction associated with microbial activities (crucial genera: Desulfobulbus, Desulfomicrobium and Desulforhabdus) was considered to decouple the Fe \& MneP cycling relationship, promoting P release at contaminated sites. The effluxes of sediment P were much higher in the Danshui River (mean 0.132 mg cm{\`A}2\$d{\`A}1) than in the Xizhi River (mean 0.038 mg cm{\`A}2\$d{\`A}1).

The sources and compositions of organic matter in the two typical states (algae-dominated and macrophyte-dominated) of shallow lakes are different, which could modulate the formation of OM-Fe-P associations and influence the internal loadings of P in lakes. In this study, OM and P bound with Fe were extracted from the sediments of algae-dominated zone (A-zone) and macrophyte-dominated zone (M-zone) in Lake Taihu via the citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite (CBD) reduction method, and were analyzed to elucidate the differences in OM-Fe-P associations between the two zones. The results showed that OM-Fe-P associations in the sediments of M-zone had higher a molar C/Fe ratio but a lower molar P/Fe ratio. Four components identified by excitation-emission matrix fluorescence coupled with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) in OM-Fe-P associations in the two zones were all humic-like substances and the relative abundance of the corresponding PARAFAC components had no significant difference between the two zones. However, the total fluorescence intensity of the humic-like components was higher in M-zone than those in A-zone. This could be attributed to the higher aromaticity of OM produced from macrophyte than that from algae, as evidenced by the difference in the easily-desorbed OM between two zones. In M-zone, high aromatic compounds which are preferentially associated with Fe, could be more produced from macrophyte plants than from algae and resulted in the higher C/Fe molar ratio. The higher C/Fe molar ratio (2.1~{\textpm}~0.9) of OM-Fe-P associations in M-zone reflected that more OM originated from macrophyte could be involved in the coprecipitation with Fe (III) and OM-Fe-P associations in M-zone were probably more resistant to the microbial and chemical reduction. Our results from the real situation confirmed the mechanism related to the role of OM composition in the reduction of OM-Fe-P associations to explain the lower internal loading of P in M-zone than that in A-zone.},

  abstract = {Eutrophication is the primary worldwide water quality issue. Reducing excessive external nutrient loading is the most straightforward action in mitigating eutrophication, but lakes, ponds and reservoirs often show little, if any, signs of recovery in the years following external load reduction. This is due to internal cycling of phosphorus (P). Geo-engineering, which we can here define as activities intervening with biogeochemical cycles to control eutrophication in inland waters, represents a promising approach, under appropriate conditions, to reduce P release from bed sediments and cyanobacteria accumulation in surface waters, thereby speeding up recovery. In this overview, we draw on evidence from this special issue Geoengineering in Lakes, and on supporting literature to provide a critical perspective on the approach. We demonstrate that many of the strong P sorbents in the literature will not be applicable in the field because of costs and other constraints. Aluminium and lanthanum modified compounds are among the most effective compounds for targeting P. Flocculants and ballast compounds can be used to sink cyanobacteria, in the short term. We emphasize that the first step in managing eutrophication is a system analysis that will reveal the main water and P flows and the biological structure of the waterbody. These site specific traits can be significant confounding factors dictating successful eutrophication management. Geo-engineering techniques, considered collectively, as part of a tool kit, may ensure successful management of eutrophication through a range of target effects. In addition, novel developments in modified zeolites offer simultaneous P and nitrogen control. To facilitate research and reduce the delay from concept to market a multi-national centre of excellence is required.},

A survey in peer-reviewed literature and Dutch grey-literature was performed to gain insight into the physical-, chemical- and biological in-lake interventions used to bring these waters towards their desired state. A critical overview is presented on efficacy of different measures to counteract cyanobacterial blooms directly via targeting the cyanobacteria or indirectly via reduction of nutrient availability. Many actions have no or limited effects on minimising cyanobacterial blooms (air-bubble- or oil screens, surface mixers, low-energy ultrasound, effective micro-organisms, fish introduction), while others are more effective, but may vary in longevity and costs (dams, excavation or dredging, hydrogen peroxide, phosphorus inactivation agents), meet legislation restrictions (copper-based algaecides, herbicides, dreissenids), or are not currently implemented (hypolimnetic withdrawal). The selection of promising interventions requires a proper diagnosis of each problem lake, based on water- and nutrient fluxes, the biology of the lake (plants, fish), the function of the lake and the characteristics of the method, such as efficacy, costs, safety and ease of implementation. In the Netherlands, ongoing diffuse loads and legacies necessitate repetitive in-lake interventions.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are intimately linked by the export of elements from watersheds. Although export is influenced by land cover within watersheds, few models evaluate how the spatial configuration of land cover influences loading. In this study we examined spatial variation of land cover at a 10 X 10 m resolution by developing a mass balance, maximum likelihood model of lake iron (Fe) concentrations in 93 watersheds. The model estimated lake iron concentrations based on loading, within-lake processes and losses. Two models were developed. One considered loading from eight land cover types, whereas the second model included the distance of each grid cell to account for Fe losses along flow paths to the lake. In-lake production and losses were accounted for as a function of lake area, water color, and discharge. If we treated watersheds as homogeneous source areas, export was estimated as 450 mg Fe m-2 yr-1; however, in spatial models export varied from negligible to 5,400 mg Fe m-2 yr-1 based on differential loadings from eight cover types. Accounting for losses of Fe based on distance from the lake did not improve the model. Although areal export of Fe was greater from wetlands, upland forests dominate the landscape and thus accounted for on average 75\% of the total Fe load. Fe losses from lakes were primarily regulated by discharge; however, water color and lake depth were also important. Overall, the analysis revealed that lake Fe concentrations are related to land cover based on strong differential Fe loadings.},

  abstract = {Phosphorus (P) levels in eutrophic lakes with restricted external P inputs often show hysteresis resulting from sediment P diagenetic recycling. Hard water oxygenated lakes are often thought to be less susceptible to P release from sediment due to precipitation of P with calcium carbonate and P sorption on iron (Fe) oxyhydroxides in oxidized surface sediments. However, perpetuated eutrophic conditions in many hard water oxygenated lakes persist despite drastic reduction of external P inputs. What limits P sediment binding capacity and drives its release from sediments in such lakes is often less understood. Here we characterize sediment P diagenetic processes driving persistent internal loading in the Bay of Quinte, a hard water, polymictic embayment of Lake Ontario, Canada. We used a multifaceted approach, combining a comprehensive three-year study of sediment P binding forms, recent sediment stratigraphy and accumulation, high spatial resolution measurement of dissolved oxygen, redox potential and pH across the sediment-water interface and depth profiles of nutrient and metals concentrations in pore water. Despite oxygenated bottom water conditions P diffusive fluxes during summer are substantial (1--6.5 mg P/m2/day), representing as much as 50\% of external P inputs. Estimated rates of benthic organic carbon degradation indicate that anaerobic organic P mineralization in anoxic sediments is the main driver of P release, which is strongly influenced by Fe reduction. Estimated rates of benthic organic carbon degradation indicate that anaerobic organic P mineralization in anoxic sediments is the main driver of P release. In surface sediment the redox sensitive P is the prevailing diagenetically reactive P phase, emphasizing strong coupling with ferric Fe. While this indicates substantial P sorption on Fe oxyhydroxides, their spare binding capacity is limited, as reducible Fe: P ratios are close to sorption limit. The calcium carbonate bound P increased with sediment depth at the expense of redox sensitive P, suggesting diagenetic sequestration into apatite with sediment burial. However, only 40\% of diagenetically reactive P forms, which account for {\textasciitilde}2/3 of the total P in surface sediment, are permanently retained during burial. Importantly, our data show that in fact significant P-flux occurs in shallow areas, with an apparent discordance with concurrent measures of long-term P release from the sediments. These results also demonstrate that short-term measures cannot be extrapolated to long-term estimates and vice versa.},

  abstract = {Lake eutrophication has long been mainly associated with phosphorus (P) inputs from overland flow. The present study gives evidence that also groundwater can carry significant loads of dissolved P. We quantified P loads from groundwater to Lake Arendsee using near-shore measurements of P concentrations at a high spatial resolution and volume fluxes of lacustrine groundwater discharge (LGD) derived from a previous study. Results show that LGD accounts for more than 50\% of the overall external P load, thus fuelling the eutrophication of the lake. Several different approaches of groundwater sampling (groundwater observation wells, temporary piezometers, and domestic wells) reveal a broad spatial heterogeneity of P concentrations in the subsurface catchment of the lake. The highest P concentrations (above 4mgl-1) were found below a settled area along the southern lake shore. Contrary to expectations, other parameters (dissolved iron, ammonium, etc.) were not correlated with P, indicating that natural processes are superimposed by heavy contaminations. Both the intensity of the contamination and its proximity to the lake inhibit nutrient retention within vadose zone and aquifer and allow significant P loads to be discharged into the lake. Although the groundwater quality was investigated intensely, the results eventually give no clear evidence of the location and sources of the pollution. As a consequence, measures to decrease LGD-derived P loads cannot target the contamination at its source in the catchment. They need to be implemented in the riparian area to eliminate groundwater P directly before it enters the lake.},

  abstract = {Internal phosphorus (P) loading is a key water quality challenge for shallow lakes. Addition of iron (Fe) salts has been used to enhance P retention in lake sediments. However, its effects on sediment geochemistry are poorly studied, albeit pivotal for remediation success. Here, we assess the factors controlling the retention of P and long-term effects following application of FeCl3 (0.5--1 mol~Fe/m2, 2010) in the eutrophic, shallow peat lake Terra Nova (the Netherlands). Treatment reduced P levels in the lake for two years, but afterwards summer release of P intensified, resulting in higher surface water P concentrations than before treatment. Porewater and sediment analyses indicate that the majority of the added Fe is still undergoing redox cycling within the top 10~cm of sediment accounting for the binding of up to 70~\% of sedimentary P. Sequential extractions further suggest that organic matter (OM) plays a key role in the resulting P and Fe dynamics: While reduction of P binding Fe(III) phases results in P release to porewaters, the produced Fe2+ remains bound to the solid phase presumably stabilized by OM. This causes P release from the sediments in excess to Fe during temporary low oxygen conditions in summer months, as confirmed by whole core flux incubation experiments. Quantitative coprecipitation of P with Fe upon reoxygenation of the water body is then impossible, leading to a gradual increase in surface water P. This first long-term study on a shallow peat lake underpins the role of OM for Fe cycling and the need to carefully consider the sediment properties and diagenetic pathways in the planning of Fe-amendments.},

  abstract = {Sulphate reducers have the unique ability to respire using sulphate as an electron acceptor. Sulphate-reducing bacteria and archaea are ubiquitous in the environment. The sulphate reducers that have been isolated and described thus far can be divided into seven phylogenetic lineages, five within the Bacteria and two within the Archaea. Most sulphate reducers belong to approximately 23 genera, with the Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the Deltaproteobacteria and the Gram-positive bacteria within the Clostridia.Sulphate reducers can thrive in a broad range of environmental conditions. They have been detected in shallow marine and freshwater sediments and in deep subsurface environments, such as oil wells, hydrothermal vents and mud volcanoes. They occur in environments with extremely low or high pH, extremely low or high temperature and high or low salt concentrations. They are also present in living organisms, such as ruminants and in the human intestinal tract. In marine worms, they form an intimate relationship with aerobic sulphide-oxidizing bacteria.Sulphate reducers play a key part in the carbon and sulphur cycles. They are extremely versatile with respect to the electron donors and electron acceptors that are used for growth. They can grow in a sulphate-dependent manner using hydrogen and a wide range of organic compounds. However, polymeric compounds (polysaccharides and proteins) are not typically used by sulphate reducers. Although named after their ability to respire using sulphate, other inorganic compounds can also be used as electron acceptors. Some sulphate reducers can even respire with oxygen.In environmental biotechnology, sulphate reducers have an important role. One unwanted effect is the production of hydrogen sulphide in anaerobic digesters that are used for waste and waste-water treatment and its role in the corrosion of iron and steel. However, sulphate reducers are also beneficially used in biotechnological processes to remove heavy metals and oxidized sulphur compounds from gas and water. In nature, sulphate reducers live in close vicinity with other microorganisms, which results in metabolic interactions with other anaerobes. In the presence of sulphate, they compete with methanogens and acetogens for common substrates, such as hydrogen and acetate. In the absence of sulphate, however, sulphate reducers grow acetogenically in syntrophy with methanogens. The complete genomes of different sulphate reducers have been, or are currently being, sequenced. Comparative analysis of these genome sequences will provide important information on their carbon and sulphur metabolism and open up the possibility for functional genomics.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment has caused phosphorus (P) accumulation in many freshwater sediments, raising concerns that internal loading from legacy P may delay the recovery of aquatic ecosystems suffering from eutrophication. Benthic recycling of P strongly depends on the redox regime within surficial sediment. In many shallow environments, redox conditions tend to be highly dynamic as a result of, among others, bioturbation by macrofauna, root activity, sediment resuspension and seasonal variations in bottom-water oxygen (O2) concentrations. To gain insight into the mobility and biogeochemistry of P under fluctuating redox conditions, a suspension of sediment from a hypereutrophic freshwater marsh was exposed to alternating 7-day periods of purging with air and nitrogen gas (N2), for a total duration of 74 days, in a bioreactor system. We present comprehensive data time series of bulk aqueous- and solid-phase chemistry, solid-phase phosphorus speciation and hydrolytic enzyme activities demonstrating the mass balanced redistribution of P in sediment during redox cycling. Aqueous phosphate concentrations remained low ( {$\sim$} 2.5 {\textmu}M) under oxic conditions due to sorption to iron(III) oxyhydroxides. During anoxic periods, once nitrate was depleted, the reductive dissolution of iron(III) oxyhydroxides released P. However, only 4.5 \% of the released P accumulated in solution while the rest was redistributed between the MgCl2 and NaHCO3 extractable fractions of the solid phase. Thus, under the short redox fluctuations imposed in the experiments, P remobilization to the aqueous phase remained relatively limited. Orthophosphate predominated at all times during the experiment in both the solid and aqueous phase. Combined P monoesters and diesters accounted for between 9 and 16 \% of sediment particulate P. Phosphatase activities up to 2.4 mmol h-1 kg-1 indicated the potential for rapid mineralization of organic P (Po), in particular during periods of aeration when the activity of phosphomonoesterases was 37 \% higher than under N2 sparging. The results emphasize that the magnitude and timing of internal P loading during periods of anoxia are dependent on both P redistribution within sediments and bottom-water nitrate concentrations.},

  abstract = {In a bog deposit containing siderite and vivianite, both minerals consist of a solid solution with Mn2+ and Ca2+. It is found that Mn is preferentially concentrated in the carbonate and also that the compositional variation within single samples is large. High Fe2+ concentrations are found in the pore water, while H2S is absent in agreement with thermodynamic predictions. Calculated saturation states for pure end-member minerals show near equilibrium with respect to rhodochrosite while with siderite up to a magnitude of supersaturation is found. Also strong supersaturation is found with respect to vivianite while with Mn3 (PO4)2 strong subsaturation prevails. Supersaturation with both siderite and vivianite cannot be explained by solid solution alone, and it is shown that their saturation states are largely controlled by pH variations. Processes which may cause the precipitation of siderite within and not outside the bog are reduction of ferric oxyhydroxides and dissolution of CaCO3 from the solid carbonate. The present data do not allow a quantitative expression for the importance of these processes. In a particular case, however, it could be shown that equilibrium with calcite controls the saturation state for siderite.},

  abstract = {Mechanisms of phosphate (PO43-) mobilization and retention were examined in iron-rich anaerobic freshwater wetland, lake, and coastal marine sediments. Direct microbial Fe(III) oxide reduction solubilized only 3-25\% of initial solid-phase PO43 during sulfate-free sediment incubation experiments. Experiments with reduced, non-sulfidic solid-phase Fe(II) rich sediment demonstrated PO43- sorption by the solid-phase, and chemical equilibrium calculations indicated that conditions were favorable for precipitation of Fe(II)-PO4 minerals [e.g. Fe3(PO4)2] in such sediments. These results suggested that much of the PO43- released from Fe(III) oxides during microbial Fe(III) reduction was captured by solid-phase reduced iron compounds (Fe(II) hydroxide-PO4 complexes and/or Fe(II)-PO4 minerals). Enhanced liberation of PO43- to sediment porewaters (33-100 \% of initial solid-phase PO43-) occurred during anaerobic incubation in the presence of abundant sulfate and was directly correlated with sulfate reduction and iron-sulfide mineral formation. Incubation of PO43 amended sediment with different amounts of sulfate demonstrated a linear correlation between PO43 release and sulfate reduction. Release of PO43 to sediment porewaters during decomposition of fresh organic matter (freeze-dried cyanobacteria) was more extensive in sulfate-amended (67\% of added organic P) than in sulfate-free sediment (17\% of added organic P), and the ratio of dissolved PO43- released to organic carbon oxidized was seven-fold higher in sulfate amended sediment despite a common level of overall organic C and P mineralization in the two treatments. Our results demonstrate that iron rich anaerobic sediments can immobilize substantial amounts of PO43- under Fe(III) oxide reducing conditions but thai extensive PO43- release will take place if sediment Fe compounds are converted to iron-sulfides via bacterial sulfate reduction.},

  abstract = {An increasing number of studies constrain the importance of iron for the long-term retention of phosphorus (P) under anoxic conditions, i.e. the formation of reduced iron phosphate minerals such as vivianite (Fe3(PO4)2{$\cdot$}8H2O). Much remains unknown about vivianite formation, the factors controlling its occurrence, and its relevance for P burial during early sediment diagenesis. To study the occurrence of vivianite and to assess its relevance for P binding, surface sediments of two hydrologically contrasting waters were analysed by heavy-liquid separation and subsequent powder X-ray diffraction. In Lake Arendsee, vivianite was present in deeper sediment horizons and not in the uppermost layers with a sharp transition between vivianite and non-vivianite bearing layers. In contrast, in lowland river Lower Havel vivianite was present in the upper sediment layers and not in deeper horizons with a gradual transition between non-vivianite and vivianite bearing layers. In both waters, vivianite occurrence was accompanied by the presence of pyrite (FeS2). Vivianite formation was favoured by an elevated iron availability through a lower degree of sulphidisation and was present at a molar ratio of total sulphur to reactive iron smaller than 1.1, only. A longer lasting burden of sediments by organic matter, i.e. due to eutrophication, favours the release of sulphides, and the formation of insoluble iron sulphides leading to a lack of available iron and to less or no vivianite formation. This weakening in sedimentary P retention, representing a negative feedback mechanism (P release) in terms of water quality, could be partly compensated by harmless Fe amendments.},

NH4Cl--P was depleted with less than half the recommended dose of Al in Lake Vallentuna sediments that contained a low concentration (0.1mg Pg-1 DW) of BD--P. Lake Finja, on the other hand, with high concentration of BD--P (2.3mg Pg-1 DW), required three times the recommended Al dose to deplete NH4Cl--P, indicating that BD--P correlated with NH4Cl--P. Six times the recommended Al-dose converted all BD--P (Fe--P) to NaOH--rP (Al--P) under anoxic conditions in the BD--P rich sediment, while one dose was enough in Lake Vallentuna. Other P-pools, defined by P-fractionations, remained constant. In order to simulate a summer resuspension event, sediments were placed in a ``resuspension chamber'' through which oxygen-saturated water with pH 9.5 passed at 100cm day-1. The iron-rich sediment released 1mg BD--Pg-1 DW of an initial 2.3mg BD--Pg-1 DW after one day. With addition of 90mg Alg-1 DW (6{\texttimes}recommended dose) the subsequent release when resuspended was only 0.25mg Pg-1 DW after one day, showing a general increase in P retention capacity with large doses of Al. It is concluded that by transforming all Fe--P to Al--P in surface sediments, this should drastically reduce internal loading of P caused by anoxic hypolimnetic water. Thus, the burial rate of potentially mobile P in accumulation sediments would increase.},

Wastewater treatment research has enhanced our knowledge of microbial mechanisms influencing P cycling, especially regarding microbes known as polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) that store P as polyphosphate (polyP) under oxic conditions and release P under anoxic conditions. However, there is limited application of PAO research to reduce agricultural P loading and improve water quality. Herein, we conducted a meta-analysis to identify articles in Web of Science on polyP and its use by PAOs across five disciplines (i.e., wastewater treatment, terrestrial, freshwater, marine, and agriculture). We also summarized research that provides preliminary support for PAO-mediated P cycling in natural habitats. Terrestrial, freshwater, marine, and agriculture disciplines had fewer polyP and PAO articles compared to wastewater treatment, with agriculture consistently having the least. Most metaanalysis articles did not overlap disciplines. We found preliminary support for PAOs in natural habitats and identified several knowledge gaps and research opportunities. There is an urgent need for interdisciplinary research linking PAOs, polyP, and oxygen availability with existing knowledge of P forms and cycling mechanisms in natural and agricultural environments to improve agricultural P management strategies and achieve water quality goals.},

  abstract = {The redistributive transport of sedimentary, redox-sensitive metals such as iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) along depth gradients in lakes or marine basins, and in particular the concentration of these elements at local depressions, has been described as ``geochemical focusing.'' However, the impact of variable redox conditions at the sediment--water interface on this process is not entirely understood. In this study, we report that the enrichment and burial of Fe, Mn, and associated phosphorus (P) in dimictic Lake Arendsee, Germany, has been affected by a transition from oligo-mesotrophic to eutrophic conditions in the first half of the 20th century. Eleven sediment cores ({$<$}50 cm long) were obtained from water depths ranging from 38.5 to 49.5 m, and analyzed for their elemental composition. The older, non-varved section, which was deposited prior ca. 1940 during oligo-mesotrophic conditions, contains up to 10 times higher Mn and 2.5 times higher Fe contents at the deep sites compared to corresponding intervals at shallower sites. Due to their high Fe content, sediments in this interval also contain up to eight times more P, at least partly owing to vivianite authigenesis. Burial of Mn occurred via Mn-carbonate authigenesis, possibly as rhodochrosite. Since ca. 1940, calcite and diatom varves have formed under eutrophic conditions, whereas Fe enrichment decreased and finally stopped due to fixation as pyrite in the shallow sites. Our results suggest that redox-controlled geochemical focusing determines the distribution of Mn and Fe, as well as the occurrence of authigenic minerals such as vivianite and Mn-carbonate.},

One possibility is, for example, to start with the sample-taking strat egies, followed by the analytical treatment of the samples, then a model presentation to substantiate the processes, and finally a quantitative evaluation of the measured profiles with regard to material fluxes and reaction rates. The reader who would prefer this sequence is recommended to begin with the Sections 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and to consult the Sections 3.1 and 3.2 later. However, in our opinion, marine geochemistry departed from its initial development stage of sample collection and anlysis some years ago. This book is therefore written with a different structure from earlier texts. The well understood theoretical knowledge on concentration profiles has to be introduced from the beginning.}

Batch experiments were conducted with CaCl2 and citric acid to characterize P release kinetics from vivianite, hydroxyapatite, and bone char. While the P release during the CaCl2 treatment was so low that only vivianite and hydroxyapatite showed a slightly higher release with increasing CaCl2 concentration, the increase of dissolved P was more pronounced for citric acid. The application of citric acid resulted in a 32,190-fold higher P release for bone char. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopic data suggested higher instability of hydroxyapatite than for bone char. The kinetic data showed that bone char, especially at a lower particle size, had a higher long-term P release than hydroxyapatite or vivianite. The suitability of hydroxyapatite and bone char as a poorly soluble, but sustainable P source is better than that of vivianite. However, the efficiency as a P fertilizer is also dependent on present soil P mobilization processes. The results underline the importance of the accessibility of fertilized or naturally bound P for plant roots to benefit from the excretion of organic acids.},

This is a serious problem that is widely expected to intensify as climate change strengthens the hydrological cycle. To address the current lack of adequate analysis, Sinha et al. present estimates of riverine nitrogen loading for the continental United States, based on projections of precipitation derived from climate models (see the Perspective by Seitzinger and Phillips). Anticipated changes in precipitation patterns are forecast to cause large and robust increases in nitrogen fluxes by the end of the century. Science, this issue p. 405; see also p. 350 Eutrophication, or excessive nutrient enrichment, threatens water resources across the globe. We show that climate change--induced precipitation changes alone will substantially increase (19 {\textpm} 14\%) riverine total nitrogen loading within the continental United States by the end of the century for the ``business-as-usual'' scenario. The impacts, driven by projected increases in both total and extreme precipitation, will be especially strong for the Northeast and the corn belt of the United States. Offsetting this increase would require a 33 {\textpm} 24\% reduction in nitrogen inputs, representing a massive management challenge. Globally, changes in precipitation are especially likely to also exacerbate eutrophication in India, China, and Southeast Asia. It is therefore imperative that water quality management strategies account for the impact of projected future changes in precipitation on nitrogen loading. An intensifying hydrological cycle should cause large increases in nitrogen runoff in the United States.

Standard recipes exist for preparing synthetic analogues of seawater, with its relatively constant composition, but, due to the diversity of freshwaters, a range of compositions and recipes is required. Generic protocols are developed for preparing synthetic freshwaters of any desired composition. The major problems encountered in preparing hard and soft waters include dissolving sparingly soluble calcium carbonate, ensuring that the ionic components of each concentrated stock solution cannot form an insoluble salt and dealing with the supersaturation of calcium carbonate in many hard waters. For acidic waters the poor solubility of aluminium salts requires attention. These problems are overcome by preparing concentrated stock solutions according to carefully designed reaction paths that were tested using a combination of experiment and equilibrium modeling. These stock solutions must then be added in a prescribed order to prepare a final solution that is brought into equilibrium with the atmosphere. The example calculations for preparing hard, soft and acidic freshwater surrogates with major ion compositions the same as published analyses, are presented in a generalized fashion that should allow preparation of any synthetic freshwater according to its known analysis.},

Sediment extraction data showed that reactive phosphorus (RP) is strongly correlated to reactive iron (RFe), suggesting that the mobility of a large portion (30--40\%) of the total sediment phosphorus pool is associated with nanocrystalline iron oxide minerals that may be influenced by redox conditions. RP concentrations in the top sediments increased throughout 2007 but decreased throughout 2008; calculations indicate that 1 mm of sediment could account for the increased total dissolved phosphorus observed in overlying water. Redox conditions were measured over 24 h in situ within sediment cores and at the sediment--water interface (SWI) at different stages of each season using voltammetry. SWI redox conditions became progressively more reduced across the season and overnight and were significantly more reducing in the presence of a bloom. Soluble RP and cyanobacteria cell counts measured at five depths through the water column strongly correlated with the most reducing conditions at the SWI. Observations suggest that redox controlled nutrient flux between the sediments and the water column is variable over diel and seasonal cycles. Cyanobacteria blooms most significantly affect SWI redox conditions, suggesting that blooms may enhance RP flux from sediments, setting up a positive feedback loop that can propagate and sustain blooms in shallow freshwater systems.},

The species has disappeared almost completely from the littoral zones of the shallow peaty lakes it once occupied, and at present it is still abundant in ditches in nature reserves and in some agricultural areas. Originally Stratiotes aloides is a species from moderately nutrient rich and moderately alkaline waters. In large parts of the Netherlands, hydrological conditions have changed considerably owing to intensified human activities. In most peaty lowlands, water quality has been influenced not only by direct eutrophication but also by the inlet of water from the rivers Rhine and Meuse, which is characterized by a high alkalinity and relatively high sulphate levels. Additionally seepage of groundwater has strongly declined, resulting in decreased iron inputs in these aquatic systems. Increased sulphate reduction rates result in the immobilisation of iron as iron sulphide and in the generation of alkalinity. As a result phosphate is liberated from iron phosphate complexes and the decomposition of organic matter is accelerated (internal eutrophication). Next, dissolved iron levels decrease strongly while toxic sulphide accumulates in sediment pore water. As a result, iron deficiency, sulphide toxicity, ammonium toxicity and increased competition by nonrooting species have al been observed to affect Stratiotes aloides vegetation. We conclude that sulphate is the master variable in the decline of S. aloides in the Netherlands.},

  abstract = {Increased phosphorus availability may provoke serious eutrophication problems in wetlands. Strong evidence indicates that sulphate induced mobilization of phosphate (internal eutrophication) has been responsible for a strong decline of the biodiversity in wetlands during the last decades. It is currently underestimated, however, that the wide spread leaching of nitrate from agricultural lands can indirectly provoke strong internal phosphate eutrophication in wetlands, via its interference with sulphur and iron biogeochemistry in the subsoil. Nitrate can mobilize sulphate from geological pyrite deposits by the oxidation of FeSx in the aquifer, leading to a decrease of nitrate and an increase of groundwater sulphate concentrations. Furthermore nitrate immobilizes iron in the subsoil by oxidizing reduced (dissolved) iron. Increased sulphate concentrations may provoke strong phosphate eutrophication in wetlands fed directly or indirectly (via surface water) with groundwater as sulphate strongly interferes with iron phosphorus chemistry and stimulates anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. Management of wetlands should therefore be approached at a broader scale which includes the landscape-scale management of groundwater systems. Leaching of nitrate to the groundwater, for instance, should not only receive attention for its potential effects on drinking water quality but above all because of the resulting large scale mobilization of sulphate from geological pyrite deposits and the immobilization of ferrous iron.},

  abstract = {This paper gives a general overview of the nature and important mechanisms behind internal loading of phosphorus (P), which is a phenomenon appearing frequently in shallow, eutrophic lakes upon a reduction of the external loading. Lake water quality is therefore not improved as expected. In particular summer concentrations rise and P retention may be negative during most of the summer. The P release originates from a pool accumulated in the sediment when the external loading was high. In most lake sediments, P bound to redox-sensitive iron compounds or P fixed in more or less labile organic forms constitute major fractions--forms that are potentially mobile and eventually may be released to the lake water. The duration of the recovery period following P loading reduction depends on the loading history, but it may last for decades in lakes with a high sediment P accumulation. During the phase of recovery, both the duration and net P release rates from the sediment seem to decline progressively. Internal P loading is highly influenced by the biological structure as illustrated by lakes shifting from the turbid to the clearwater state as a result of, for example, biomanipulation. In these lakes P concentrations may be reduced to 50\% of the pre-biomanipulation level and the period with negative retention during summer can thus be reduced considerably. The duration of internal loading can be reduced significantly by different restoration methods such as dredging to remove accumulated P or addition of iron or alum to elevate the sorption capacity of sediments. However, an important prerequisite for achieving long-term benefits to water quality is a sufficient reduction of the external P loading.},

The rate of H               2               accumulation was variable, and a range of 0 to 16 nmol g               -1               h               -1               was recorded. An immediate increase of the methanogenic activity by 2 to 3 nmol g               -1               h               -1               was apparently due to a release of the competition for H               2               by the absence of SO               4               2-               reduction. If propionate and butyrate were completely oxidized by the SO               4               2-               -reducing bacteria, the stoichiometry of the reactions would indicate that H               2               , acetate, propionate, and butyrate account for 5 to 10, 40 to 50, 10 to 20, and 10 to 20\%, respectively, of the electron donors for the SO               4               2-               -reducing bacteria. If the oxidations were incomplete, however, the contributions by propionate and butyrate would only be 5 to 10\% each, and the acetate could account for as much as two-thirds of the SO               4               2-               reduction. The presence of MoO               4               2-               seemed not to affect the fermentative and methanogenic activities; an MoO               4               2-               inhibition technique seems promising in the search for the natural substrates of SO               4               2-               reduction in sediments.},

  abstract = {Sustainable management of lakes requires us to overcome ecological, economic, and social challenges. These challenges can be addressed by focusing on achieving ecological improvement within a multifaceted, co-beneficial context. In-lake restoration measures may promote more rapid ecosystem responses than is feasible with catchment measures alone, even if multiple interventions are needed. In particular, we identify restoration methods that support the overarching societal target of a circular economy through the use of nutrients, sediments, or biomass that are removed from a lake, in agriculture, as food, or for biogas production. In this emerging field of sustainable restoration techniques, we show examples, discuss benefits and pitfalls, and flag areas for further research and development. Each lake should be assessed individually to ensure that restoration approaches will effectively address lake-specific problems, do not harm the target lake or downstream ecosystems, are cost-effective, promote delivery of valuable ecosystem services, minimize conflicts in public interests, and eliminate the necessity for repeated interventions. Achieving optimal, sustainable results from lake restoration relies on multidisciplinary research and close interactions between environmental, social, political, and economic sectors.

  abstract = {The role of redox-related sediment phosphorus (P) release in shallow polymictic lakes remains poorly understood. Our previous studies in large and shallow Lake Peipsi suggested the importance of the redox-related P release in internal P loading. In the current study, we explored the validity of this hypothesis by also considering organic sediment P (Org-P). We analysed spatio-temporal changes in diffusive P flux and sediment P forms determined by P fractionation and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in summer 2021. Using 1997--2021 data, we computed internal P load (IL) by two methods and studied their relationships with several water quality variables. Anoxia of sediment surfaces and P release progressed with an increase in water temperature during summer. In the long-term, IL estimates by two methods were similar (mean values: 315 and 346~mg/m2/year) and correlated with the predicted anoxia of sediment surfaces (AApred). A contribution of sediment iron-bound P (Fe-P) to P release was indicated by the positive correlation of Fe-P with orthophosphate (NMR) in the short-term studies. No similar evidence was found for Org-P, which contradicts the common tendency to attribute internal P loads largely to Org-P in eutrophic lakes. Nevertheless, organic matter seemed to support reductive dissolution, because seasonal changes in sediment Org-P correlated with those in Fe-P, and organic matter content and diffusive P flux were negatively correlated over different sites. Complex bottom morphology and hydrology affected spatial distribution of the sediment P forms and masked the relationships between sediment P variables and P release. Finally, the importance of redox-related release was reflected in significant relationships between AApred and associated IL with Secchi depth transparency, chlorophyll a concentration, and the biomass of phytoplankton and cyanobacteria. To our knowledge, this is the first time when such direct evidence was provided for a large polymictic lake.},

Because of high anthropogenic forcing, these systems have poor water quality, with large consequences for the provisioning of ecosystem services. Understanding of the main pressures on urban water quality is key to successful management. We identify six pressures that we hypothesize to have strong links to anthropogenic forcing including: eutrophication, aquatic invasive species, altered hydrology, altered habitat structure, climate change, and micropollutants. We discuss how these pressures may affect water quality and ecological functioning of urban waters. We describe how these pressures may interact, posing challengers for water management. We identify steps that need to be taken towards sustainable restoration, recognizing the challenges that potentially interacting pressures pose to water managers.},

  abstract = {Stability relationships between Al-goethite, Al-hematite, boehmite and gibbsite are presented in terms of water activity [H2O], temperature (T), grain size and bulk-composition in the system Fe2O3-Al2O3-H2O at a total pressure of 1 bar. Al-goethite and Al-hematite are treated as ideal solid solutions, the former of the end-members FeOOH (goethite) and AlOOH (diaspore) and the latter of the end-members Fe2O3 (hematite) and Al2O3 (corundum). Using log Ksp provided by the literature for the various phases involved, the common associations observed in laterites, bauxites and ferricretes do not have stability fields over geologically reasonable intervals of [H2O] and T. Consequently a new internally consistent set of log Ksp values is proposed and used, and allows such associations to have actual stability fields in the appropriate diagrams. The new log Ksp values used in the calculations are such that the solubilities of the end members are greater than those commonly listed. This is in agreement with natural observations which show that such minerals, are generally poorly crystallized and of very small size. The assumption of an ideal solid solution in aluminous goethite and aluminous hematite combined with the new log Ksp values leads to prediction of composition limits for these two minerals which agree well with observed values. The fact that an ideal solid solution must extend continuously from one end-member to the other is masked by the appearance of other stability fields (e.g. gibbsite or boehmite) which cross and overlap a part of the solid solution stability fields of AlOOH-FeOOH and Fe2O3-Al2O3. R{\'e}sum{\'e} Des relations de stabilit{\'e} entre la goethite-Al, l'h{\'e}matite-Al, la boehmite et la gibbsite sont pr{\'e}sent{\'e}es en fonction de l'activit{\'e} de l'eau [H2O], de la temp{\'e}rature (T), de la taille des grains et de la composition chimique dans le syst{\`e}me Fe2O3-Al2O3-H2O, {\`a} une pression totale de 1 bar. La goethite-Al et l'h{\'e}matite-Al sont consid{\'e}r{\'e}es comme des solutions solides id{\'e}ales, respectivement, entre les p{\^o}les FeOOH (goethite) et AlOOH (diaspore), d'une part et les p{\^o}les Fe2O3 (h{\'e}matite) et Al2O3 (corindon), d'autre part. En utilisant les log Ksp de la litt{\'e}rature, des diff{\'e}rentes phases rencontr{\'e}es, les associations min{\'e}rales commun{\'e}ment observ{\'e}es dans les lat{\'e}rites, bauxites et cuirasses ferrugineuses n'ont pas de domaine de stabilit{\'e} dans les intervalles d'activit{\'e} de l'eau [H2O] et de temp{\'e}rature que l'on peut attendre dans la nature. Par cons{\'e}quent, un nouvel ensemble de valeurs de log K est propos{\'e} et utilis{\'e}, afin que de telles associations min{\'e}rales pr{\'e}sentent des domains de stabilit{\'e} dans les diagrammes appropri{\'e}s. Les nouvelles valeurs de log Ksp utilis{\'e}es dans les calculs sont telles que les solubilit{\'e}s des p{\^o}les soient plus grandes que celles habituellement publi{\'e}es. Ceci est en bon accord avec les observations de terrain, qui montrent que les min{\'e}raux naturels sont, g{\'e}n{\'e}ralement, mal cristallis{\'e}s et de tr{\`e}s petites tailles. L'hypoth{\`e}se de solution solide id{\'e}ale dans la goethite alumineuse et l'h{\'e}matite alumineuse combin{\'e}e avec les nouveaux log Ksp permet de pr{\'e}dire les limites de composition de ces deux min{\'e}raux compatibles avec les valeurs exp{\'e}rimentales. Le fait qu'une solution solide id{\'e}ale est d{\'e}finie de fa{\c c}on continue d'un p{\^o}le {\`a} l'autre est masqu{\'e} par l'apparition de domains de stabilit{\'e} d'autres min{\'e}raux (gibbsite ou boehmite, par exemple) qui couvrent partiellement les domaines des solutions solides AlOOH-FeOOH et Fe2O3-Al2O3.},

We used a demand-driven substance flow model to explore the sensitivity of global phosphorus production to interventions of the food system including: reduction in animal fraction in the diet (AFD); manure use efficiency (MUE); animal food yield (YA); phosphorus use efficiency (PUE); the fraction of food that is wasted (FWF); the fraction of food waste recycled (FRE); and the fraction of human waste recycled (WRE). The model indicated that AFD and YA are the most influential interventions, and they interact with PUE and MUE. Furthermore, there is a minimum in AFD and YA below which it becomes necessary to increase mining. Another result is that reducing food waste is about 80 times more effective than recycling food waste in reducing P demand. Finally, the model was used to explore the global carrying capacity for humans on the basis of P sources other than mining. These sources may satisfy P requirements for as many as 2.5 billion people. If significant improvements were made in all of the considered interventions simultaneously, as many as 14.7 billion people could be sustained.},

  abstract = {Sulfur cycling in freshwater ecosystems has been previously considered minor, and the direct evidence of its impacts on iron and phosphorus cycles in freshwater sediments remains unclear. In this study, mesocosms with amended acetate and various sulfate concentrations (1.5--3.0 mmol L-1) were set up to investigate sulfur cycling and its influences on iron-rich freshwater sediments. Acetate addition induced hypoxia and provided substrates, which stimulated the sulfur cycling with evidence of SO42- decline, {$\Sigma$}S2-, S0 increase and corresponding variations of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Meanwhile, the growth of iron-reducing bacteria (IRB) was suppressed, and lower Fe(II) release was correspondingly related to larger SRB abundance at higher sulfate level, indicating that microbial iron reduction might be blocked by SRB activities. However, continuous dissolution of Fe(III) oxides and generation of iron sulfides were observed, suggesting that sulfide-mediated chemical iron reduction (SCIR) became the dominant iron-reducing pathway, and Fe(II) was buried as iron sulfides instead of released to water column, which resulted in a transition of iron cycling into unidirectional SCIR. Consequently, continuous dissolution of Fe(III) oxides led to significant increase of PO43- concentration in the water column and sediment pore-water, revealing the phosphorus mobility in sediments derived from the SCIR process. To note, sustained accumulation of iron sulfides was observed even without {$\Sigma$}S2- presence, suggesting that {$\Sigma$}S2- precipitation occurred prior to diffusion. Thus, {$\Sigma$}S2-missing sulfur cycling seemed ``cryptic'' in this study. To highlight, the transition of the iron-reducing pathway and resulting PO43- release can be induced even under current sulfate level of Lake Taihu, and elevated sulfate levels could significantly intensify SCIR and phosphorus mineralization. Thus, the stimulated iron deposition and the resulting phosphorus release derived from the sulfur cycling should be paid more attention to in the treatment of eutrophic freshwater ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The study focuses on the response of a sulphate rich lowland river (River Spree) to a further increase in sulphate concentration as a result of mining activities in its catchments. It was hypothesized that riverine sediments could be conservative against an increase in sulphate concentration relating to both the intensity of sulphate reduction and the accompanying P mobilization. The usually lower amount of organic matter, compared to lakes or wetlands, and the high contents of iron oxides in the Spree sediment from discharged mining waters should counteract an enhanced P mobilization. Three short-term incubation experiments were carried out to test the sensitivity of different sediment horizons (0--10, 10--20 and 20--30 cm), the influence of temperature (5 and 25 {$^\circ$}C) and the effect of a rising sulphate concentration (2.6--7.8 mM) on P mobilization rates (PMR) and sulphate reduction rates (SRR). Contrary to our initial hypothesis sulphate played a key role for P mobilization in riverine sediments because (1) all sulphate treated horizons showed a significant increase in pore water P concentrations, (2) increasing sulphate concentrations led to rising SRR and PMR, (3) the highest response on sulphate-mediated P mobilization was observed by a temperature enhancement of 20 {$^\circ$}C. PMR increased one order of magnitude at all tested sulphate concentrations, but these increases in PMR only slightly effected the P concentrations in the overlying water. In conclusions, an increase of internal P load is only expected in case of doubling the recent in situ sulphate concentrations, but extended warm periods as an effect of climate change or increasing temperature, respectively, could be of more importance.},

  abstract = {The technique of diffusion gradients in thin films (DGT) was used to measure in situ fluxes of metals at fine spatial resolution (1.25 mm) in the surface sediments (029 cm) and immediately overlying water of Esthwaite Water, UK. DGT measures labile metal species in situ by immobilizing them in a layer of Chelex resin after diffusion through a 0.4 mm polyacrylamide gel. The measured mass per unit area which accumulates in a known time can be used to calculate an in situ flux from the porewaters to the resin. This flux to the resin can be interpreted to provide porewater concentrations or in situ fluxes of metal from solid sediments to porewaters. Concentrations of Zn and Cd in the porewaters were well buffered by rapid ({$<$} min) equilibria with the solid phase, allowing them to be measured by DGT. Particulate Mn was so tightly bound that it was not released to the porewaters within a timescale of hours, supply to the DGT device being solely by diffusion. Nickel, Cu, and Fe represented intermediate cases where there was partial resupply from solid phase to porewaters. In these cases the results from DGT provided a direct measurement of the mean in situ flux (mol cm-2 s-1) from solid to solution phase during 24 h deployment: Nickel (0.5--1 {\texttimes} 10-15), Cu(0.5--2.5 {\texttimes} 10-16), Fe (1.5--2.5 {\texttimes} 10-8). The generally good in situ availability suggests that porewater concentrations are controlled by adsorption/desorption processes rather than solubility or coprecipitation. These first measurements of trace metals at mm resolution showed tightly defined ({$<$} 1.5 mm) maxima at the sediment water interface. Their location, 1.5--3.0 mm above the broader Fe and Mn maxima, supports previous evidence which indicated they are due to release of metals from rapidly decomposing organic material. Increased spatial resolution will be required to resolve fully the surface maxima to define the zone of metal release, the concentration gradients to overlying water, and underlying sediments and remobilization fluxes.},

  abstract = {This study is devoted to addressing the effects of algae blooms on sulfur cycle and the consequent phosphorus mobility in the sediments of freshwater lake ecosystems. A mesocosm experiment was conducted to investigate these effects through monitoring the dynamics of sulfur (S), iron (Fe) and phosphorus (P) in water and sediments, and their diffusion fluxes at the sediment-water interface (SWI). In addition, the abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in the water column was also detected. The addition of the algae lead to an increase of SRB, a drastic decline of sulfate and a significant increase of total dissolved sulfide ({$\Sigma$}S2-, the peak value of near 3.0\,mmol/L on day 6) in the water column. These results suggest the sulfate reduction was dramatically promoted during algae decomposition. Indeed the {$\Sigma$}S2- was 2 to 3 times of SO42- initial concentration, and higher {$\Sigma$}S2- was produced with higher algal biomass. Moreover, the diffusive flux of {$\Sigma$}S2- at the SWI was negative, indicating that diffusion of {$\Sigma$}S2- from water column toward sediment was occurring. These results indicated that algae decomposition might also be another important source of {$\Sigma$}S2- (termed ``algae-derived {$\Sigma$}S2-'') in addition to sulfate reduction. The increase of Fe(II) in surface sediment pore-water was slightly delayed compared to the {$\Sigma$}S2- generation in the water column, which illustrated that Fe oxyhydroxides in sediments were transformed into Fe(II) through chemical reduction of {$\Sigma$}S2-. Concomitantly, the vertical distribution of PO43- in high amounts algae group suggested that desorption and release of iron oxides-bound PO43- occurred in sediments. Collectively, algae bloom can boost the lake eutrophication not only through direct release of nutrients but also through the high production of {$\Sigma$}S2-and indirect promotion of phosphorus mobility in sediment.},

In this study, seasonal variations on three types of sediments from central lake, dredged and algae accumulated areas in a eutrophic lake in China, Lake Taihu, were investigated. The high temperature in summer and the accumulation of algae are conducive to the reduction processes in freshwater lake sediments. Iron reduction was observed as the major anaerobic process in all types of sediments, while sulfate reduction was weak in central and dredged lake areas. However, strong sulfate reduction with increase of sulfate reducing bacteria and sulfides generation (119.5~{\textpm}~0.2~{$\mu$}mol~L-1) was found in surface sediments in algae accumulated areas. Based on the results of Fe reduction rate and the quantity of Fe reducing bacteria, extensive sulfate reduction in algae accumulated sediments inhibited the microbial Fe reduction, and the {$\Sigma$}S2--mediated chemical Fe reduction (SCIR) dominated instead. Iron was principally stored in the sediments as Fe sulfide compounds, which weakened the rebinding of phosphorus and stimulated phosphorus mobilization. Therefore, attention should be paid to the alteration of Fe cycling and phosphorus mobility caused by the SCIR in algae accumulated sediments and the consequent effects on the eutrophication of freshwater lakes.},

  abstract = {Except for excessive nutrient input and climate warming, the rapidly rising SO42- concentration is considered as a crucial contributor to the eutrophication in shallow lakes; however, the driving process and mechanism are still far from clear. In this study, we constructed a series of microcosms with initial SO42- concentrations of 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 mg L-1 to simulate the rapid SO42- increase in Lake Taihu, China, subjected to cyanobacteria blooms. Results showed that the sulfate reduction rate was stimulated by the increase in initial SO42- concentrations and cyanobacteria-derived organic matter, with the maximal sulfate reduction rate of 39.68 mg (L d)-1 in the treatment of 150 mg L-1 SO42- concentration. During the sulfate reduction, the produced maximal {$\sum$}S2- concentration in the overlying water and acid volatile sulfate (AVS) in the sediments were 3.15 mg L-1 and 11.11 mg kg-1, respectively, and both of them were positively correlated with initial SO42- concentrations (R2=0.97; R2=0.92). The increasing abundance of sulfate reduction bacteria (SRB) was also linearly correlated with initial SO42- concentrations (R2=0.96), ranging from 6.65{\texttimes}107 to 1.97{\texttimes}108 copies g-1. However, the Fe2+ concentrations displayed a negative correlation with initial SO42- concentrations, and the final Fe2+ concentrations were 9.68, 7.07, 6.5, 5.57, 4.42, and 3.46 mg L-1, respectively. As a result, the released total phosphorus (TP) in the overlying water, to promote the eutrophication, was up to 1.4 mg L-1 in the treatment of 150 mg L-1 SO42- concentration. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the effect of rapidly increasing SO42- concentrations on the release of endogenous phosphorus and the eutrophication in lakes.},

  abstract = {Nutrient conditions in European surface waters have improved over recent decades. However, there has been no overall decrease in the nitrate concentration in groundwater.     The average phosphate concentration in European rivers has decreased markedly over the last two or three decades (by 0.002 milligrams per litre of phosphate-phosphorous (mg P/l) per year~(1.3 \% per year). The average total phosphorus concentration in lakes also decreased over the period 1992-2018 (0.0003 mg P/l per year~(0.8 \%)). The decrease in phosphorus concentration is likely related to improvements in waste water treatment and the reduction of phosphorus in detergents. However, as for nitrate in rivers there is a tendency for concentrations to level off in recent years, especially for rivers.     On average, the nitrate concentration in European rivers decreased by 0.01 milligrams per litre of nitrate-nitrogen (mg N/l) per year (0.02 \% per year) between 1992 and 2018, but the concentration has levelled off since around 2010. The decrease is likely related to effects of measures to reduce agricultural inputs of nitrate and improvements in waste water treatment. However, the apparent stabilisation of river nitrate concentrations in recent years may call for further measures to be taken.},
